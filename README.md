# Social Graphs

After a reading group session on _Neither Vertical Nor Horizontal_ by Rodrigo Nunes, our group had a discussion about
whether hierarchy was "natural" and what hierarchy is. I wanted to study if it was true that hierarchies naturally
formed in social networks. To do this, I wrote a program to randomly generate vertex-edge graphs using 
[Price's Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%27s_model)
and test for the appearance of hierarchy. In this simple experiment, a model of a growing social network does
tend toward hierarchy. We don't have to take this fatalistically. It may show that if we value equality, it takes
conscious effort and planning to distribute influence and counteract the inequalities in hierarchy.
I describe the work in [Are Social Networks Naturally Hierarchical?](report/hierarchy_in_social_networks.pdf).
